##State Manangement
The state management library which has been used in this project is redux.

##Styling Convention used
I have made use of  styled-components library for styling in react.

##Reusable Components
I have tried to make the project more modular by breaking into components which can be used in other projects as well.

#NavbarContainer component is used for navigation bar in the project. It can be used by simply using the component in the other project and by simply passing the values as props.

#CirculatImage component is used to display the interactive fingertips. Just use this component and pass values as props for different styling properties for the ciruclar image.

#CustomButton component is used for buttons in this project. Pass the event as well as other important data as props, the event can then be handled in the parent component. The color and size of the buttons can be directly changed.

#ContainerWithHotspot compoenent for showing the details of the output Image. It can be imported in any projects where circular and rectangular box is required.

#IntereactiveImage component is used as the main screen where all the child components are used.

##Other notable points worth mentioning:
I have used camelcasing,
functional components,
redux library,
styled-components.

I have also added comments where I found commenting should be necessary.
